# Root Cause Analysis and Solution for Railway Deployment Issue

## Root Cause
After analyzing the error logs and comparing Docker vs Railway environments, I've identified the fundamental issue:

**The application requires a running DBus daemon, but Railway's container environment doesn't automatically start system services.**

Unlike a standard Docker deployment where you can configure init systems or service managers, Railway has limitations on running background daemons. The error messages have evolved from:
1. First: "ss: command not found" - Missing network utility
2. Then: "No such file or directory" for DBus socket - Missing socket files
3. Finally: "Connection refused" - Socket exists but no service is listening

This progression confirms that the core issue is not just missing files or environment variables, but the absence of a running DBus daemon service.

## Solution
The solution is to explicitly start the DBus daemon in the foreground as part of your application's startup process, and keep it running alongside your main application.

This approach:
1. Starts the DBus daemon directly in the container
2. Ensures it remains running throughout the application lifecycle
3. Properly initializes the system bus that the application requires
4. Avoids relying on Railway to support background service initialization

## Implementation
The fix modifies both the start.sh script and adds additional Chromium flags to reduce dependency on system services:

1. Explicitly start DBus daemon in system mode
2. Wait for it to initialize
3. Add it to the wait list so it stays running
4. Add additional Chromium flags to improve stability in container environments

This solution addresses the root cause rather than just working around symptoms, ensuring your application has the system services it needs to function properly in Railway's environment.
