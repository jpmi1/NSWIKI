# Simplified Solution for Railway Deployment

## Root Cause Analysis
After analyzing the working build logs from the official SiYuan Railway Docker image, I've identified that:

1. The DBus-related errors are **non-fatal warnings** that don't prevent the application from running successfully
2. The application continues to function normally despite these errors
3. Attempting to start the DBus daemon is unnecessary and may cause more issues than it solves

## Simplified Solution
The most effective approach is to:

1. Create the necessary directories to prevent "No such file or directory" errors
2. Set environment variables to minimize error logging
3. **Not** attempt to start the DBus daemon service
4. Allow the non-fatal DBus errors to occur but be ignored

This approach matches what's happening in the working deployment - the application runs successfully despite DBus errors because they're just warnings, not critical failures.

## Why This Works
SiYuan is designed to function in various environments, including those without a full DBus implementation. The DBus-related code paths are likely used for optional features like desktop notifications or system integration, which aren't essential in a headless/server deployment like Railway.

## Implementation
The simplified start.sh script:
1. Creates the necessary directories
2. Sets environment variables to minimize error logging
3. Doesn't attempt to start any background services
4. Focuses on the core application startup

This approach is more reliable and matches how the official image works.
